# AI Agent Memory System - Quick Start

## Simple Setup

Just tell your AI agent:

```
Please clone and set up the AI Agent Memory System for me:

1. Clone the repository: https://github.com/trose/ai-agent-memory-system
2. Run the setup script to create the memory directory structure
3. Initialize my active memory with basic project context
4. Show me how to use the system for our current project

I want to use persistent memory so you can remember our work across sessions and build on previous progress instead of starting fresh each time.
```

That's it! Your AI agent will handle the technical setup and explain how to use the system.

## What This Does

The AI agent will:
- Clone the repository and run `./setup.sh`
- Create `~/ai_memory/` directory structure
- Set up initial memory files
- Explain how to maintain context across sessions
- Start using persistent memory immediately

## Customization

Once set up, you can customize:
- Memory structure for your specific project type
- Templates for different workflows
- Additional directories for specialized needs

The system adapts to your workflow automatically.

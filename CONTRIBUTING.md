- Markdown: Use consistent heading levels and formatting
- Documentation: Clear, actionable, with examples

### Testing Requirements
- All new functions must have unit tests
- Examples must be tested for correctness
- Integration tests for memory system workflows
- Performance tests for ORC operations

### Commit Message Format
```
type(scope): brief description

Longer explanation if needed

Fixes #issue-number
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `refactor`, `perf`, `style`, `ci`

Examples:
```
feat(memory): add batch processing for ORC analytics

```

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=utils --cov-report=html

# Run specific test category
python -m pytest tests/test_memory_utils.py
python -m pytest tests/test_templates.py
```

### Test Categories
- Unit Tests (`tests/unit/`) - Individual function testing
- Integration Tests (`tests/integration/`) - Full workflow testing  
- Performance Tests (`tests/performance/`) - Memory system performance
- Example Tests (`tests/examples/`) - Validate example configurations

### Writing New Tests
```python
import pytest
from utils.memory_utils import save_project_status

def test_save_project_status():
    """Test that project status is saved correctly."""
    test_data = {"project": "test", "status": "active"}
    result = save_project_status(test_data)
    assert result["project"] == "test"
    assert "last_updated" in result
```

## 📚 Documentation Standards

### README Updates
- Keep examples current and working
- Update feature lists when adding capabilities
- Maintain consistent tone and formatting

### Code Documentation
```python
def update_active_memory(key: str, value: Any) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Update active memory with new key-value pair.
    
    Args:
        key: Memory key to update
        value: New value to store
        
    Returns:
        Updated memory dictionary
        
    Raises:
        MemoryError: If memory file cannot be written
        
    Example:
        >>> update_active_memory("project", "My App")
        {"project": "My App", "last_updated": "2024-08-21T..."}
    """
```

### Example Templates

## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability

### Quick Response Process

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please help us protect our users:

üî• For Critical Vulnerabilities (immediate risk)
- Email: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]
- Expected Response: Within 4 hours
- Severity: Data loss, remote code execution, privilege escalation

‚ö†Ô∏è For High/Medium Vulnerabilities
- Email: [INSERT SECURITY EMAIL]  
- Expected Response: Within 24 hours
- Severity: Information disclosure, local privilege escalation

üìã For Low Impact Issues
- GitHub Issues: [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/trose/ai-agent-memory-system/security/advisories/new)
- Expected Response: Within 72 hours

### What to Include in Your Report

1. Clear Description: What the vulnerability does
2. Reproduction Steps: Detailed steps to reproduce
3. Impact Assessment: What an attacker could achieve
4. Affected Versions: Which versions are vulnerable
5. Proposed Fix: If you have suggestions (optional)

Example Report:
```
Subject: [SECURITY] Path Traversal in memory_utils.py

Description: The save_project_status function doesn't validate file paths, 
allowing directory traversal attacks.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Call save_project_status with malicious path: "../../../etc/passwd"
2. Observe file creation outside intended directory

Impact: Arbitrary file write, potential system compromise

Affected Versions: All versions <= 1.0.0

Proposed Fix: Add path validation using os.path.realpath()
```

## üîç Security Considerations

### File System Security

Current Protections:
- Memory files stored in user's home directory
- No automatic execution of memory content
- JSON parsing with safe defaults

User Responsibilities:
- Ensure `~/ai_memory/` has appropriate permissions
- Don't store sensitive credentials in memory files
- Regularly review memory content for sensitive data

Best Practices:
```bash
# Set secure permissions
chmod 700 ~/ai_memory
chmod 600 ~/ai_memory/*.json

# Exclude from backups if containing sensitive data
echo "ai_memory/" >> ~/.gitignore_global
```

### Data Privacy

What We Don't Store:
- No telemetry or analytics data
- No automatic uploads or syncing
- No access to your memory files

What You Control:
- All data stays on your local machine
- You decide what to include in memory
- You control backup and sharing

Sensitive Data Guidelines:
```json
{
  "‚ùå_avoid": {
    "passwords": "never store passwords",
    "api_keys": "use environment variables instead",
    "personal_info": "avoid PII in memory files"
  },
  "‚úÖ_safe_to_store": {
    "project_context": "architecture decisions, tech stack",
    "learning_patterns": "effective collaboration approaches",
    "workflow_preferences": "development practices"
  }
}
```

### Input Validation

Current Validations:
- JSON schema validation for memory files
- File extension checks
- Basic path sanitization

Planned Improvements (v1.1.0):
- Comprehensive path validation
- Memory file size limits
- Content sanitization options

## üîß Security Features

### File System Protection
- Memory files use `.json` extension only
- No executable file creation
- Directory creation limited to memory structure

### Input Sanitization
- JSON parsing with error handling
- UTF-8 encoding enforcement
- No eval() or exec() usage

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation on permission errors
- Safe failure modes
- No sensitive information in error messages

## üèóÔ∏è Secure Development Practices

### Code Review Requirements
- All security-related changes require review
- Input validation changes need extra scrutiny
- File system operations reviewed for path traversal

### Testing Standards
```python
def test_path_traversal_protection():
    """Ensure malicious paths are rejected."""
    malicious_paths = [
        "../../../etc/passwd",
        "..\\..\\windows\\system32\\config\\sam",
        "/etc/shadow"
    ]
    for path in malicious_paths:
        with pytest.raises(SecurityError):
            save_project_status({"path": path})
```

### Dependencies
- Minimal dependency footprint
- Regular security audits of dependencies
- Automated vulnerability scanning

## üìã Security Checklist for Contributors

### For All Contributions
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] Input validation for user-provided data
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] File operations use safe path handling

### For File System Operations
- [ ] Path validation prevents directory traversal
- [ ] File permissions are appropriately restrictive
- [ ] No execution of user-provided content
- [ ] Safe handling of large files

### For Memory Operations
- [ ] JSON parsing handles malformed input
- [ ] Memory size limits are enforced
- [ ] No arbitrary code execution
- [ ] Safe serialization/deserialization

## üéØ Threat Model

### In Scope
- File System Attacks: Path traversal, arbitrary file write
- Data Injection: Malicious JSON content, code injection
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive data exposure
- Denial of Service: Resource exhaustion, large files

### Out of Scope
- Social Engineering: User education responsibility
- Physical Access: Local machine compromise
- Network Attacks: No network functionality
- OS-Level Exploits: Operating system vulnerabilities

### Assumptions
- User has legitimate access to their machine
- File system permissions work correctly
- Python interpreter is trusted
- Memory directory is not shared with untrusted users

2. Fix Development: Create minimal, targeted fix
3. Testing: Comprehensive security testing
4. Disclosure: Coordinate with reporter
5. Release: Security patch with advisory
6. Communication: Notify users of update
